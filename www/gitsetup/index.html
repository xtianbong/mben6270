# WLU - CP202
---
This repository contains all the code and lectures for CP202 (Fall 2019).

If you have any questions, email jsandoval@wlu.ca.

# Running Locally
The following steps will help you set up the software required to run locally.

## Step 1

You need to clone the repository using git. You may already have git installed. To verify you have it installed, run the following command:
```
$ git --version
```

If you get something that looks like the following, you're all set (go ahead an clone the repo):
```
git version 2.12.2
```

If you need to install git, you have different options. In Mac OS X the very first time your run git, if not installed, the OS will give you the option to install it (follow the instructions).

For a different OS, use the appropriate installer from here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git.

When you're done installing and verifying that it runs properly, clone the repository with the following command (you can choose any convinient directory--for my machine, I chose /User/jose/Documents):

```
$ cd /User/jose/Documents
$ git clone https://github.com/josefelixsandoval/wlu.git
```

## Step 2
If you already have a web server installed in your machine, go to Step 3.

To run a local web server you have multiple options. I'll give you two (pick only one).

**Option 1: Python Built-in Web Server**\
If you are running MacOS (or have Python installed in your Windows machine), Python comes with a built-in web server.

Go to your desired directory and check which version of Python version you are running by using the following command:

```
$ python --version
```

If your version of Python is 2.7, you'll get an output similar to this:

```
Python 2.7.10
```

Then run the following command:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

If your version is 3.7, then run the following command:

```
$ python -m http.server
```

You then can view your local website by going to the following address in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

If you don't have python installed and would like to use the built-in server, intall the latest version of Python and then run the command for 3.7. You can find the latest version here https://www.python.org/downloads/ (this works for Windows and MacOS).

**Option 2: Node.js Web Server**\
If you have Node.js and the http-server module already installed, skip the installation part and just run the http-server command as listed in item 3 here.

To install Node.js:

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download and install it.
2. Open a shell terminal or command prompt (in Windows) and install http-server with the following command:

```
$ npm install http-server -g
```

3. Run the following command after you are in your desired directory:

```
$ http-server -p 8000
```

To view your local web server, point your browser to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

## Step 3
After you have cloned this repository, go to the root directory of the repo and run your prefered web server. For example, my local version of the site is in the following directory:

```
$ cd /User/jose/Documents/wlu
```

I then run the built-in Python web server as follows:

```
$ python -m http.server
```

If everything has been set up properly, point your web browser to:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

You should see the homepage for the site. I'll be updating it weekly, but it should look something like this:

![Home Page](http://wlu-cp202.appspot.com/img/homepage.png)
  </div>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = marked(document.getElementById('content').innerHTML);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
